# lander_scanner
A fun project I've found in "Real World Python" by Lee Vaughan! Possibly the hardest project I've attempted thus far. The idea is to take a NASA MOLA image of Mars and analyze it to select potential landing sites, based on a number of predetermined factors.

I started this project as soon as I saw it in the book. I had fun learning about how to utilize the Pillow library, Numbpy, and tkinter to find potential landing sites on Mars.
Also, I learned a little about using standard deviation and the factors to include in logic for a problem like this. Such as wanting to land in lower elevations since the air is denser.
I realize that my own attempt to this project is far from perfect and is an ongoing project. I do want to modify this program potentially to analyze photos of fictional planets, like Tattoine from 'Star Wars,' for fun.
